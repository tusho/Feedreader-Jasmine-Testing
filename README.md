# Tasks I tested in this project:

1. I tested that loops through each feed in the allFeeds object and ensures it has a URL defined and that the URL is not empty.

2. I tested that loops through each feed in the allFeeds object and ensures it has a name defined and that the name is not empty.

3. I tested that the menu element is hidden by default.

4. I tested that the menu changes its visibility when the menu icon is clicked (both view and hide).

5. I tested to ensure that when the feed is fully loaded, there is at least one single entry (asynchronously).

6.  I tested that when a new feed is loaded, the content actually changes (asynchronously).
